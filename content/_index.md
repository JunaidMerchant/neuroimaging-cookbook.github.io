**Project Description:**
Anyone ever Google how to accomplish a task for neuroimaging data more than once? For example, I‚Äôve Googled "how to extract a mask from a parcellation scheme" or "how to output the time series from an ROI to a .csv file" hundreds of times because I can't remember the exact command/function or flags to pass (and every time I am reminded just how many times I've visited the same webpages): ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24925845/101920789-39767900-3b9a-11eb-9f7c-5b88d7e3ce80.png)

There are countless software packages with widely different commands and options to perform all sorts of different functions when working with neuroimaging data. But remembering them all is nearly impossible!  

The [Neuroimaging Cookbook](https://github.com/neuroimaging-cookbook/neuroimaging-cookbook) will centralize ‚Äúcode snippets‚Äù (or ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù) for different, specific, and simple tasks in neuroimaging that people can incorporate in their own analysis pipelines. And most importantly, it would be scalable so that anyone can contribute their random, useful code snippet. 

The idea is inspired by [30 Seconds of Code](https://www.30secondsofcode.org) (specifically, [30 Seconds of Python](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/python/p/1)), where people can easily reference code (across software) for different neuroimaging tasks like: how to convert across different image formats (e.g., BRIK/HEAD, img/hdr, nii, etc), flatten the lower triangle of a representational similarity matrix, extract a mask from a parcellation, output the time-series from an ROI to a .csv /.txt file, etc. Not exactly tutorials, but "code snippets" that people can adapt for their own scripts, apps, or Jupyter Notebooks.

**Goals for Brainhack Global 2020:**
Easy:
- Determine a list of simple, common tasks in neuroimaging (e.g., extracting a mask, converting BRIK/HEAD files to NIFTI), divide tasks among project members, and create various snippets of code to accomplish each task
- Organize each snippet by utility (e.g., data cleaning, data organization/processing, analysis), software package (e.g., AFNI, FSL), and programming language (e.g., Bash, Python, R)
- Test cookbook on desktop and mobile

Intermediate:
- Cookbook website design (should be a searchable webpage)
- Create documentation so that others can easily contribute

**Good first issues:**
1. Create first batch of recipes for use in the cookbook (Team 1)
2. Develop the cookbook webpage (Team 2)

**Skills (at least one of these):**

- Experience working with neuroimaging data
- Website development/deployment
- Basic Git/GitHub knowledge
- Documentation

**Communication channels:**
https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/neuroimaging-cookbook

**Contributions:**
All contributions will be recognized in the cookbook and follow the [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) specification. Contributions of any kind are welcome!
